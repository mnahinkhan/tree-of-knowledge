# Tree of Knowledge

### Introduction
This is a project that hopes to document relationships between fields of human knowledge. Possible relationships
between fields of knowledge includes:

- pre-requisite: when one field needs to be learnt before the other can be learnt. For example, "counting" is a
 pre-requisite of "addition".
- enabling: when learning one field allows you to learn another field (opposite of above, so "counting" enables
 "addition", or "addition" is an enabling field of "counting").
- subfield: when a field is a subset of another. For example, "geometry" is a subfield of "mathematics".
- super-field: when a field is a superset of another. "Mathematics" is a super-field of "geometry".

We hope to map these relations with the help of the wider community through a website.

### Field mastery and conversation
In addition to the inter-relationships between various fields, we hope to associate two useful pieces of information
with each field of human knowledge:
- Mastery guide: a recommendation on resources to use to start learning the field of knowledge.
- Conversation: a chronological record of the academic "conversation" that has occurred in the field, in terms of papers
 published and significant defining events that have occurred (such as founding of fields or new technologies).
    - A broad field such as "molecular biology" may list brief significant historic events, such as discovery of DNA
     structure, mRNA introns, etc.
     - On the other hand, a comparatively narrower field such as "Malat1 research" might list recent and historically
      significant papers that have changed the outlook of the research field or are informally considered important by
       academics in the field (personal perspectives by those contributing to the field are especially valued here!).

### Who is this helpful for?
- students interested in gaining skills in particular subjects (via the mastery guide)
- students and other academics that may be new to a subfield of research and would like a quick overview of the field
such as hot topics or research gaps to address
    - In the long term, it would become easier for academics to start understanding an academic paper they have come across


### What this project isn't
This project is not an encyclopedia. It doesn't hope to store all of human knowledge. Instead, the focus is on
 relationships between fields of knowledge and _guiding_ the user towards understanding the field by pointing to
  resources and giving a historic/current-state-of-affairs background.
  
  
### cs50 - Web Programming
I am making this website to fulfill a final project requirement for the cs50 web programming course.
 Once I have a good working site to fulfill the requirements, I might consider continuing to expand the project with
  external help. I believe I have fulfilled the complexity and _____ requirements because:
